# Multiprocessing with `multiprocessing.Process`

The `multiprocessing` module in Python offers a high-level interface for creating and managing separate processes through a process-based parallelism API similar to the `threading` module. 

The `Process` class allows for creating and managing separate memory spaces that run concurrently, enabling true parallelism in Python programs. 

It's particularly important in CPU-bound tasks where the Global Interpreter Lock* (GIL) becomes a limiting factor. 

Each `Process` instance runs in its own Python interpreter and memory space, providing better performance for computationally intensive operations than threads, which share the same memory space and are constrained by the GIL.

> *The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex (mutual exclusion lock) used in CPython, the reference implementation of Python. Its purpose is to ensure that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, even on multi-core systems.

## Key Advantages

- Enables true parallelism by leveraging multiple CPU cores.
- Avoids GIL restrictions inherent in Python threads.
- Provides process isolation, which can improve robustness in certain applications.
- Flexible process lifecycle management (start, join, terminate).

## When to Use

Use `multiprocessing.Process` when:

- Overcoming limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which restricts true parallelism in multi-threaded code.
- Achieving process-level isolation for improved security, fault tolerance, or modularity.
- Scaling execution across multiple CPU cores to meet performance requirements.
- Leveraging multiple processes without necessarily requiring significant memory upgrades, depending on the memory footprint of each task.

> For I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading from disk, accessing a database, or making network requests), alternatives like `threading` or `asyncio` may provide better performance and lower overhead.

## Practical example

See [`example_multiprocessing.Process.py`](./example_multiprocessing.Process.py) for a complete example.

## Important Considerations

- Always protect the entry point of the program using `if __name__ == '__main__':` to prevent unintended behavior when using multiprocessing on platforms like Windows.
- Processes do not share memory; data must be exchanged via `multiprocessing.Queue`, `Pipe`, `Manager`, or other IPC mechanisms.
- Process startup is more resource-intensive than threads; consider `multiprocessing.Pool` for managing a fixed number of worker processes more efficiently.

## Summary

`multiprocessing.Process` is a robust abstraction for achieving parallelism in Python, particularly well-suited to CPU-intensive workloads. It provides a straightforward API for process creation and management, with important considerations for inter-process communication and resource overhead.
